				<b>WARNING!</b> JavaScript is required for this experiment to
				function properly, but it seems to be disabled on your computer. We
				recommend using the Google Chrome browser for best performance.
			</p>
			<h3>Setup:</h3>
			<p>1. Disable distractions</p>
			<p>Please take a moment to disable any distractions around you
				(silence your cell phone, close browser tabs that will result in
				notifications or other distractions, and set your computer to do not
				disturb mode if you are able). Also, please click the full screen
				button in the top right corner.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="setup_sound" style="display: none;">
			<h3>Setup:</h3>
			<p>2. Configure sound</p>
			<p>
				Please adjust the volume bar below so that you can comfortably hear
				the beeps (you should not have to strain to hear them). If you
				cannot hear the beeps even at higher volume levels, make sure your
				system/computer volume is on. If you do not hear any beeps, please
				do not proceed to the next step, but <a
					href="mailto:albertg@mit.edu">contact the researcher</a>.

			<h3>Setup:</h3>
			<p>3. Choose key</p>
			<p>
				Please select your preferred key. Do this by pressing a single key
				in a comfortable location on your keyboard (that you would be
				comfortable tapping with your pointer finger for an extended period
				of time). The key you select will appear below. You may select any
				key <i>except</i> the space bar.

			<h3>Instructions:</h3>
			<p>Please pay careful attention to the following instructions.</p>
			<button type="button" class="nextButton fixed" id="toInstr1">NEXT</button>
		</div>
		<div id="instr_1" style="display: none;">
			<h3>Instructions:</h3>
			<p id="instr_1_text">1. Place your dominant hand in a comfortable
				position with your pointer finger on the key you selected (z), like
				in the photo example below.</p>

			<h3>Instructions:</h3>
			<p>2. You will hear a sequence of beeps. We would like you to tap
				(completely press and then release the key and slightly lift your
				finger) in synch with the beeps. Try to complete each key press at
				the same time as each beep.</p>
			<p>Some sequences are challenging. Just do your best to press the
				key at the same time as the beep.</p>

		<div id="instr_3" style="display: none;">
			<h3>Instructions:</h3>
			<p>3. Once the sequence of beeps stops, keep tapping the key to
				continue the sequence as if the beeps were still there. Keep
				continuing the sequence until you see the word STOP.</p>
			<p>NOTE: Treat each sequence independently of the others.</p>

			<h3>Demo:</h3>
			<p>Please watch the video demonstration of an example sequence.
				Notice how the participant lifts their finger off the key between
				presses, but not excessively.</p>

			<h3>Get ready!</h3>
			<p>Now you will do some real sequences. Some will be more
				difficult than others. Please do your best to press the key in synch

			<p>After you click "Start next sequence" there will be a ~2

			<p>Let's see how you actually performed while tapping along:</p>
			<div id="plot"></div>
			<p>Above is a graph showing your averaged results. Results in the
				“0” bar show the number of key presses that were exactly aligned
				with the beep. It’s not possible to perfectly align all your key
				presses with the beeps. It's typical to show some delays, especially
				with difficult sequences. We are interested in how people try to
				move in sync and notice differences in various conditions. Thank you
				for helping with our experiment!</p>
